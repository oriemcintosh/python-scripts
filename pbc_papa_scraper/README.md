# PBC Property Appraiser Public Access (PAPA) to CSV Script

This Python application will take the location of an existing CSV file with owner information, gathered previously, from https://pbcpao.gov and uses the `Property Control Number` to query the tool and create an updated CSV file based on the query.

> [!NOTE]
> An advanced search can be done based on subdivision, which could be the name of your community / area based on the county using their advanced search query https://pbcpao.gov/AdvSearch/AdvanceSearch#

I plan to make another application / script that will take the CSV from an advanced search and get rid of the duplicate entries based on `Property Control Number`.
